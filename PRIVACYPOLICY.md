# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to CrimeInMyArea! This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our application. CrimeInMyArea is an app which updates you on criminal activity at your location. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.

## Information Collection and Use

### No Data Collection

CrimeInMyArea does not collect, store, or process any personal data from its users. The app functions solely as a tool to show criminal activity in your area.

### Location

When you use CrimeInMyArea to find criminal activity, we do not store your location. Your location is used to send a request to the data.police.uk website to get the criminal activity in your area.

## Third-party libraries

When you open the app (and occasionally in the background), a web request will be made to data.police.uk in order to find nearby criminal activity, alongside the nearest police force. CrimeInMyArea does not collect any of your data, whatsoever.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
